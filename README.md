This is Christian Egwim solution to the Doctorlib Developer Test.

I have fixed all the errors on the unit test by passing the valid number of expected value as an array.

I allowed the function to return availabilities on as many days as requested by adding "numberOfDays" as a second argument to the "getAvailabilities" function and asigned it a default number 7.

Then I implemented API design and documentation using express. In this I also used JOI for my form validation and finally setup app server default port number the will be necassry to access the API via http call.
